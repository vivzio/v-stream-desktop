## Releasing

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated building and releasing. When you create a new release on GitHub, the workflow will automatically:

1. Build the app for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
2. Build for both x64 and ARM64 architectures where supported
3. Upload all binaries to the GitHub release

To create a release:

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/vivzio/v-stream-desktop/releases) page
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Create a new tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
4. Publish the release

The workflow will automatically build and attach all platform binaries to your release.

### Manual Release (Draft)

You can also trigger a draft release manually:

1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/vivzio/v-stream-desktop/actions)
2. Select "Build and Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Optionally specify a version tag
5. Check "Create draft release"
